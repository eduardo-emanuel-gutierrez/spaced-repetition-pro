## Installation

### From Obsidian Community Plugins (Recommended)
1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to Community Plugins
3. Search for "Spaced Repetition Pro"
4. Install and enable the plugin

### Manual Installation
1. Download the following files from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/eduardo-emanuel-gutierrez/spaced-repetition-pro/releases)
   - main.js
   - manifest.json
   - styles.css (if available)
2. Create a new folder inside your Obsidian vault at:
```
<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/spaced-repetition-pro/
```

3. Copy the downloaded files into that folder.
4. Restart Obsidian and enable the plugin in Settings â†’ Community plugins.


## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Track Notes for Review
Right-click on any markdown file or folder and select:
- **"Track for Review"** - Add notes to your review system
- **"Untrack from Review"** - Remove notes from review system

### 2. Start Reviewing
- Use the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for "Start Review Session"
- Or open the Spaced Repetition view from the left sidebar

### 3. Review Process
1. **Filter Phase**: Choose which notes to review using metadata filters
2. **Question Phase**: See the note title and try to recall the content
3. **Answer Phase**: View the full note content and rate your recall:
    - **Again (1)**: Forgot completely - will review again soon
    - **Hard (2)**: Difficult but remembered - shorter interval
    - **Good (3)**: Remembered with effort - normal interval
    - **Easy (4)**: Remembered perfectly - longer interval

### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts During Review
- `Spacebar`: Show answer / Rate as "Good"
- `1`: Rate as "Again"
- `2`: Rate as "Hard"
- `3`: Rate as "Good"
- `4`: Rate as "Easy"

## Configuration

Access settings via Settings > Plugin Options > Spaced Repetition Pro:

- **New cards per day**: Maximum number of new notes to introduce daily (1-1000)
- **Data file location**: Where to store review data (default: `spaced-repetition-data.json`)

## How It Works

The plugin uses the SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm to calculate optimal review intervals:

1. **New notes** start with a 1-day interval
2. **Successful reviews** increase the interval exponentially
3. **Failed reviews** reset the note to learning phase
4. **Difficulty ratings** adjust future intervals dynamically

The algorithm adapts to your performance, showing difficult content more frequently and easy content less often.

## Filtering System

Filter notes by their frontmatter properties:

- **Single filters**: `tag = work`
- **Multiple filters**: `tag = work AND status = active`
- **OR logic**: `tag = work OR tag = personal`
- **Array support**: Works with list properties like tags

## Data Storage

All review data is stored in JSON format within your vault. The data includes:
- Review intervals and ease factors for each note
- Daily progress counters
- Next review dates

Your data remains portable and can be backed up with your vault.

## Requirements

- Obsidian v0.15.0 or higher
- Notes should be in Markdown format (.md files)
- Frontmatter metadata recommended for filtering functionality
